# Stock Performance Analyzer

## Overview
The Stock Performance Analyzer is a Python project built using the Streamlit framework. It provides a user-friendly web interface for analyzing the performance indicators of various stocks. The project utilizes historical stock price data and computes key metrics, such as moving averages and relative strength index (RSI) to help users make informed investment decisions.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: The project offers an intuitive and interactive dashboard where users can input the stock symbol, select the desired date range, and view the performance indicators on dynamic charts.
- **Moving Averages**: Users can visualize and analyze the stock's moving averages over the selected period, enabling them to identify trends and potential buy/sell signals.
- **RSI Analysis**: The project calculates the relative strength index (RSI) for the chosen stock and displays it on a chart. Users can utilize this information to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

## Usage
1. Upon launching the app, you will see an input field where you can enter the stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) that you want to analyze.

2. Select the desired date range by clicking on the calendar icons for the start and end dates.

3. The app will display various performance indicators, such as moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands, on interactive charts. Interact with the charts by zooming in/out or panning to view specific details.

4. Use the insights from the performance indicators to make informed investment decisions based on your analysis of the stock's historical data.
